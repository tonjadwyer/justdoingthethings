# just doing the things
Hello! Thanks for stopping by. 


You see, I'm quite busy breaking things at the moment. Once I get them put back together I intend to write some notes here so I don't have to go through **that** pain again. 


the Things include:
- FME Workbenches
- FME Server Jobs
- Geodatabases
- ArcGIS Models
- Docker containers
- Postgres and almost any other database
- Other people's code often in these languages:
  - python, BASH, R, javascript, node, C++, C#
- Data pipelines that could include all or some of these elments
  - AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, Step Functions, Orchestrations, Message Queues, Fargate, EC2), 
  - Google APIs
  - FME Cloud Automations


When I'm not breaking (I mean *building*) things - I'm organizing, documenting, planning - always striving for a cleaner approach, and clearer way. I develop data process flows, mentor others to build their own, and code in whatever language makes sense at the time. My work always involves data, and often has GIS element. 


Drop back later and see what I've been up to.
